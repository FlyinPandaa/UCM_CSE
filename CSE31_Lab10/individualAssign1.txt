1. How many levels of caches does your CPU have (L1, L2, L3, etc.)? Is there separate L1 cache for data 
and instructions? 

    There are two L1 cache for data and instructions, L2 cache, and L3 cache.

2. How big is each level of cache? 

    The size of the 3 levels of cache is the following L1 cache is 6x32 bytes, L2 cache is 6x256kb, and L3 cache is 12mb.

3. What is the block size (sometimes it is called line size)?

    The block size is 6 blocks.

4. Are the caches direct-mapped or set associative? If set associative, how many ways? 

   Yes it is set associative, and the l1 cache is 8-way, L2 is 4-way, and L3 is 16-way.

5. With L1 data cache, how many tag bits, index bits, and offset bits?

    L1 data cache has, 22 tag bits, 8 index bits, and 2 offset bits.
