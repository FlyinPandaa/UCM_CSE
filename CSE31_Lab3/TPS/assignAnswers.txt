Assignment 1:

1. Why do we need to pass the size of array to the function?

    We need to pass in the size of the array to the bubble sort function, because we need to know how many iterations we need.

2. Is the original array (the one being passed into the function) changed at the end of this function? 

    Yes, because the original array is being sorted with the bubble sort algorithm.

3. Why do you think a new array (s_array) is needed to store the result of the sorted values (why not 
update the array as we sort)? Hint: look at what the main function does. 

    We are printing out both the original and sorted array in separate lines.
