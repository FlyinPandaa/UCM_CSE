TPS 2

1. How can you open a terminal from your Linux computer?
    Can open the terminal by going to the windows powershell or by opening the Ubuntu program(that needs to be installed).

    a. Can you open more than 1 terminal at the same time? 
        Yes, you can open more than one terminal at the same time.

    b. Why do you think you want to open more than 1 terminal at the same time? 
        To be able to work with multiple files that create a single program. Also sometimes you want to only see a certain file/code to run.

2. In the terminal, how can you tell what are contents inside the current directory (i.e., what is the 
command)? 
    You would use the "ls -a" command to get all of the contents of a certain directory.

3. From your current directory, how can you navigate to Desktop directory? 
    By using the "cd ." command to get back to Desktop directory.

4. While you are in Desktop, create a new directory called CSE31. How do you do this? 
    You would use the "mkdir CSE31" command to create a new directory/folder through the windows powershell or command terminal.

3. What command do you type in the terminal to compile your main.c? 
    The command that you type in the terminal is "gcc c main.c" .

4. How do you know if your program has compiled successfully? 
    If there isn't any shown errors in the terminal and starts a new line in the terminal.

5. What does the –c flag do in gcc? 
    The "-c" compiles the c file/program.

6. What does the –g flag do in gcc? 
    The "-g" generates generates debug information to be used by GDB debugger.

7. How do you change the executable name from main to cselab1?
    You would use the "mv main.c cselab1.c" command to change the name of main.c to cselab1.c. Can also change file name with "gcc -o cselab1".

8. What happens when you compile your code by typing gcc main.c only?
    Compiles, but will have to use the default "./a.out" output command.

9. Now, let us run the program you have just compiled. What command do you use?
    First make sure you are in the right directory. Afterwards type in "gcc main.c -o main", this will compile the code and give the executable
    the "main" name. Now to run the file/program, ".\main". If no errors, you will recieve your output.
